This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to incorrect input types. The function 'myFunction' is designed to double its input, however it does not handle non-numeric or negative inputs gracefully.  The 'bug.m' file contains the buggy code.  The 'bugSolution.m' file provides a solution that incorporates robust input validation to prevent errors and unexpected results.
